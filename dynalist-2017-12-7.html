Initially, this will be to remain alert and to come back from distractions.  As the classes progress, you may want to set an intention for each meditation, based on the new section introduced.  We also discussed that, as we continue the meditations, you may also find that you’d like to set a daily intention for how you want to respond to each day’s events.<br> <br>Heart Felt Desire/ Purpose (which links the reason for taking this class, to strong and deep desire that you have for yourself or someone you care about, or to an overall sense of meaning, values or purpose you have in your life.) Recalling this can help us to do the practice during times when we don’t feel like it. It also gives us a broader perspective of aligning our actions with how we want to live our lives.<ul><li>#Recording [Intention and Heartfelt Desire](https://drive.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/file/d/0B18fGM-kJim1TUFsTXhIRks0SUxPQXdUZkZlc21ZMzZjVEpr/view?usp=sharing)</li></ul></li><li>!(2017-10-12 13:00) <br>Body sensing is a body scan that prompts participants to notice any feeling or sensation in these areas instead of trying to visualize them. Doing this helps to concentrate and focus the mind, (while also connecting the mind with the body)  and soothes our nervous systems.  Remember also that you can choose to stay focused on one body area until you are ready to move onto a later body area.<ul><li>#Recording [Body Sensing (long)](https://drive.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/file/d/0B18fGM-kJim1WFZFbUxDM0pIeEhQY2VoOGJzZWZaUDdqNlEw/view?usp=sharing)</li><li>#Recording [Body Sensing (short)](https://drive.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/file/d/0B18fGM-kJim1YmNualBBTUdMNmdnejF4T1R4S3JrS0J1T3lR/view?usp=sharing)</li><li>#Recording [Body Sensing - Sleep](https://drive.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/file/d/0B18fGM-kJim1UW1mdEFDTzlUZ0VKdnF1UU55N3lfV1hkWHJZ/view?usp=sharing)</li></ul></li><li>!(2017-10-19 13:00) <br>As we discussed with the breathing section, inhale to a slow count of two, hold for a brief second and then exhale for a count of four.  Both the inhale and exhale is through your nose.  The exhale should be enough to make you slightly tighten your abdomen. (This helps to activate the relaxation response.  This activates the relaxation response.  If breathing this way is uncomfortable, tune out the instructions, do your own shorter 1:2 breathing or just breathe normal pace, counting each breath up to 7, and then start over again, until this section is complete. <ul><li>#Recording [Breath Sensing and Physical Sensations](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B18fGM-kJim1ZUZJX2tneVZKTmgxSHZ4Vkd3MnhtUDJ0YmRv)</li><li>#Recording [Breath Sensing (2016)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B18fGM-kJim1TnU0Z1JhV1hEQTVBS2h0cjhFV3M3R1ZTaks0)</li><li>#Recording [Breath Sensing Sleep](https://drive.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/file/d/0B18fGM-kJim1NXlYYXNCQ0w4WWtOMWI3Sll3RFB1UEFNTE9J/view?usp=sharing)</li><li>Breathe2Relax App<ul><li>[Android Play Store Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.t2health.breathe2relax&amp;hl=en)</li><li>[Youtube video - "Breathe2Relax"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEZ1dvZuJYc&amp;list=PL8ABF9C2342A85A0A&amp;index=1)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>!(2017-10-26 13:00) <br>We discussed choosing an emotion that you want to experience more or a difficult emotion that you  want to be able to tolerate more. Alternating this with the Inner Resource or Heartfelt Desire can be helpful in cultivating the experience of Welcoming all of our emotions.  Please feel free to modify the practice as discussed today to fit where you are at this time.<br> <br>We also discussed a reminder of using opposites of physical sensations to shift out of the physical heaviness/fatigue,  that can occur with depression or significant stress.  Changing our tone and posture, as we shift from heavy (low vocal tone) to light (straighten posture, higher in vocal tone) can also be helpful. <ul><li>#Recording [Being with Emotions](https://drive.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/file/d/0B18fGM-kJim1aWJUVEFpeWNrajRqWC01S1Nnc3o0NkVUNUVV/view?usp=sharing)</li></ul></li><li>!(2017-11-02 13:00) <br>Please remember when choosing a difficult emotion such as anxious, angry etc, to choose a memory where this comes up that is not too strong.  So, if you were to scale the intensity of feeling this difficult emotion (10 being strongest ever,) that you would choose a memory where this emotion was around a 3 or 4 in intensity. (enough where you can feel it in your body.) When thinking of a  the opposite emotion, it's OK to choose a memory  that has an intensity at an 8, 9 or 10 as that supports the practice of getting "unstuck."<br> <br>Please also remember to turn to your inner resource if you feel an emotional response to be too strong to handle.  Also, if another emotion comes up that seems to be stronger and "wants" your attention more than the one you originally chose to inquire into, feel free to switch to that emotion. Remembering, that this is your practice. So, if you find it to be too overwhelming all together, feel free to turn off the recording and turn on the Inner Resource, body or breath-sensing.<ul><li>#Recording [Opposites of Emotion](https://drive.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/file/d/0B18fGM-kJim1NUQySTdEd0xoTkpXTk0yMFN5WXFJbzBXY2Nn/view?usp=sharing)</li></ul></li><li>!(2017-11-09 13:00) <br>Today, we discussed choosing an emotion that you want to experience more or a difficult emotion that you  want to be able to tolerate more.   While in a relaxed state, we imagined what it would be like to relate to our emotions as though they were alive, coming to us and having a conversation.  First, describing to ourselves, what they would look like, shape, color, “flavor,” or a vague, formless presence. In choosing one particular emotion in advance (or just meeting one that arises) we  engage in a conversation with them, asking them “what do you want?”  “What do you need?” and what action do you want me to take into my daily life?”<br> <br>Engaging in this exercise while in a meditative state can be helpful in cultivating  a relationship with our emotions while also experiencing the information they bring us.  As you continue to experiment with this way of relating to emotions, please remember that you can to turn to your inner resource or Heartfelt Desire at any time, during the practice.<ul><li>#Recording [Emotions as Messengers](https://drive.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/file/d/0B18fGM-kJim1RHBxNVVNR3FMTmQzb3BLektobkFQSTVBcWdn/view?usp=sharing)</li></ul></li><li>!(2017-11-16)<br>We stayed with the emotion theme, adding a section that focuses on gaining larger perspective. It's called "Stepping In and Back."  We discussed how stepping in and really feeling the emotion, allows us to remain connected to our body experience, and also to tolerate that experience.  We also recognize when there are times when we feel overwhelmed with things, it can feel like 100% of our entire experience.  But,  when shifting language from, (for example,) I'm anxious" to "feelings of anxiety are present," we create a sense of distance, allowing us to experience that we are more than our emotions.  <br><br>We also take a stance of observing, helping us to access larger perspective thinking, which can lead to insight. Taking the stance of the observer, we then take another step back, toward,  being the Awareness in which all of these experiences arise, and ask what that feels like. From this stance, we can tap into the general sense of well-being, that is constant, even amidst the changing circumstances that life brings our way.. <br>(Please also remember that you can call up your Inner Resource at any time during the meditation.)<ul><li>#Recording [Stepping In and Back](https://drive.google.com/a/buffalo.edu/file/d/0B18fGM-kJim1Vm5nQmhxbTRUUXNXMHN3Sk85VnNjQUdxUlRN/view?usp=sharing)</li></ul></li><li>!(2017-11-30 13:00) <br>As we discussed, just like with the emotions, we are purposely bringing up  a thought/belief in a way that helps us to be with it; challenging its validity by exploring times when the opposite is also true. Doing this over time can bring a sense of broader perspective and contribute to a sense of well-being.<br> <br>We also explored stepping in and back by labeling the type of thought/belief that it is and noticing how that affects our response to and relationship with it.<ul><li>#Recording [Opposites of Thought and Stepping Back](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B18fGM-kJim1RmZLelJxQ1I5blVQbjhBaDhFd2YwZDFjeGxj)</li></ul></li><li>!(2017-12-07 13:00) <br>Research shows the physiologic benefits of experiencing joy (or any of the related emotions along the continuum of joy.)  These experiences release endorphins (natural pain killers) and other chemicals that contribute to a feeling of well-being.  Even small amounts of joy are shown to improve immune, respiratory and cardio-vascular functioning.<br><br>iRest also teaches that while these moments of joy can be fleeting, practicing meditation can also lead us to accessing the Joy of Awareness, that is always present amidst the turbulence that life can bring our way.<ul><li>#Recording [Joy](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B18fGM-kJim1bV9MOGxEeWFpUGk4eG5zX2xXQTFIOTU2Mk00)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></body></html>
